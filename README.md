# SGCovidTracker

This Web Application is built using Vue.JS and integrates publicly available APIs to display COVID-19 cases in Singapore.
The API exposes parameters that allows for filtering which may be added into the Web Application in the future for modularity.

This is a alpha version of the Web Application however due to time constraints, i am not able to commit to it.

Make sure to run npm-install to download the required modules.
